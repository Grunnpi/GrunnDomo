# MotionEye

Today _(6th Nov 2019)_ instsallation following official instruction failed.  
I don't remember how I did last time, but anymay, here is what I do today

official [MotionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye) distribution

What|Why
----|---
``sudo -i``|easier to switch up to sudo for all next steps
``apt-get install motion``|motion regular package, as dependencies in official doc are outdated.
``pip install motioneye``| motionEye on top by Python installer
